## Description

This project is a browser game featuring a Tomagotchi pet that needs to eat, sleep, play, and morphs or evolves at specific time intervals. The game is designed to feature good utilization of HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Beyond that, the game will rely on DOM manipulation using jQuery, CSS animations, and JS classes for OOP.

## User Stories/game logic

    - The game begins when the user clicks start. The user is prompted for a name for their pet. At that time the timers begin for countdowns on each of the attributes as well as for the age of the pet. A "hatch" animation gets the user started and prompts them to name their pet.
    - Every 20 seconds, the hunger/sleepiness/boredom counters increment by 1. The user can click the "Play", "Lights out", or "Feed" buttons to initiate any of those actions and decrease the total on any one those attributes by 1. The attribute buttons can each only be clicked once every 10 seconds.
    - At 5 minutes the pet morphs/evolves into it's second stage/form and at 10 minutes it evolves into its final stage/form
    - If at any point the hunger/sleepiness/boredom counter reaches 10, the pet dies. The game can be restarted with a new pet at that point.
    - If the user keeps the pet alive and healthy for 15 minutes, they win!

## Instructions

    -Once you click start, give your Tomagotchi a name!
    -Utilize the Feed, Lights, and Play buttons to keep your stats below 10 at all times.
    -Be aware that the Lights button disables all the user buttons for 5 seconds so use it intentionally.
    -Good luck!
